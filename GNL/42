Here double is a return type of function, p2f is name of the function pointer and (double, char) is an argument list
of this function. Which means the first argument of this function is of double type and the second argument is char
type.

Lets understand this with the help of an example: Here we have a function sum that calculates the sum of two numbers
and returns the sum. We have created a pointer f2p that points to this function, we are invoking the function using
this function pointer f2p.
